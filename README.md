TestCon Vilnius 2017 Test Automation Hackathon

# Description
It was one working day hackathon. The assignment was to create a test automation framework for a test case
where a user should login to Amazon.com, buy a PS4 and a particular video game. Criterias for mentioned items were: 
they should be at best available price, they should be delivered by a specific time and should be bought from a seller
with a decent rating. 

Project is not completed. There are lots of improvements to be done. Nevertheless, during a very tight schedule
we created this semi working project from scratch.
